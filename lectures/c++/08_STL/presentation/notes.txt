Async is the lazy function. You don't actually run the async function up until it's needed later in the code.

An allocator is an object which is taking care of spawning enough memory for the map elements and it also constructs them. It takes also care of their deallocation.

Allocator job:
	AUTO p = <t>(malloc(7*size_of(t));

	new(p) = bla;
	new(p+1) = bla2;


We actually have allocated 2 memory address here

In order to destroy we would actually do:

	p -> ~T();
	p+1 -> ~T();

	free(p);

A map is basically a red and black tree

&**this: //First you take the object, then you call the reference operator and take the address
